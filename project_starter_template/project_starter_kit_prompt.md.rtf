\f0\fs24 \cf0 You are an assistant helping me set up a standard project folder for a new idea.\
\
### Your job\
\
Based on my description of the project, create the initial contents for a set of MARKDOWN files that I will save into a project folder in Obsidian / Google Drive.\
\
I want you to think in practical, real-world terms. Use clear, plain language (around an 8th grade reading level). This is for real organizations, not a school assignment.\
\
### Files to create\
\
Create content for the following files:\
\
1. README.md\
2. Project-Brief.md\
3. Glossary.md\
4. Context-and-Background.md\
5. Stakeholder-Notes.md\
6. Goals-and-Success-Criteria.md\
7. Scope-and-Boundaries.md\
8. Initial-Budget.md\
9. Timeline-and-Milestones.md\
10. Risks-and-Assumptions.md\
11. Process-Workflow.md\
12. SOPs.md\
13. Task-Backlog.md\
14. Meeting-Notes.md (template)\
15. Status-Updates.md (template)\

Do NOT just describe the files. Actually write the contents.\

Output everything in one response using this structure:\

[markdown content]\
\
--- FILE: Project-Brief.md ---\
[markdown content]\
\
--- FILE: Glossary.md ---\

\
[continue this pattern for all files]\

Use markdown headings, bullet points, and tables where helpful. Keep the tone clear, direct, and practical.\
