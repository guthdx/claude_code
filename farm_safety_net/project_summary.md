# A Better Way: Farm Safety Net Reform Initiative

## Project Overview
A Better Way is a four-year initiative to fundamentally restructure US farm safety net programs, addressing the most significant threat to farm viability since the 1980s farm crisis. The initiative connects immediate farmer financial crisis assistance with systemic policy reform.

## The Problem
US commodity farmers face severe financial challenges from falling prices, rising input costs, and trade wars. Current safety net programs systematically favor large-scale industrial farms over family-scale operations, accelerating farm loss and concentration of land ownership. We are at a tipping point where the Jeffersonian ideal of farmer-owned land is giving way to neo-feudalism—farmland increasingly owned by investment vehicles rather than farmers.

Key statistics from 2022 Census of Agriculture:
- Cover crops on less than 6% of US cropland despite decades of education and incentives
- Average farmer age increased from 57.5 to 58.1 despite beginning farmer programs
- $135B spent on ad hoc safety net programs over 8 years, yet 141,733 farms lost between 2017-2022
- Black farms lost at 8.1% rate, Native farms at 3.4%, White farms at 0.77%

The Market Facilitation Program (MFP) model used by Trump administration provides largest payments to largest farms, accelerating consolidation rather than preventing farm loss.

## The Solution: Two Integrated Initiatives

### 1. No Farm Lost
Communications campaign and resource hub providing:
- Immediate resources for farmers in financial danger
- Farmer-to-farmer videos and guidance from those who survived crisis
- Materials for organizations working with farmers
- Clear messaging about importance of farmer ownership of land
- "Join Us" campaign for public commitment to farmer ownership

### 2. Rethinking the Safety Net
Policy development process creating new safety net framework based on six principles:
1. Equivalent benefits regardless of scale, crop, or market
2. Recognize multilevel resilience strategies that reduce risk
3. Support diversification and decentralization
4. Encourage farmer innovation and entrepreneurship
5. Balance rather than amplify market concentration
6. Limit taxpayer cost—true safety net, not profit center

Working group of policy experts will meet quarterly, develop policy criteria, test models through research and casework, and build strategic partnerships for implementation.

## Communications Strategy (3 Phases)

**Phase 1:** Focus on farmer experience and financial crisis, build engagement infrastructure, establish unlikely partnerships

**Phase 2:** Use farmer stories backed by policy analysis to establish drivers and need for reform

**Phase 3:** Release and advocate for policy reforms through diverse channels

## Target Outcomes
- Overall vision for fundamental change to US farm policy structure
- Specific legislative and administrative policy initiatives
- Ongoing analysis of emerging agricultural policy
- Strategic organizing and advocacy for implementation
- Prevention of farm loss and transition to investment ownership of farmland

## Strategic Rationale
Providing crisis assistance is both morally right and strategically advantageous. Farm financial crisis is recruiting ground for extremism and source of social harm. Current safety net failures unite family-scale commodity producers with advocates for sustainable, regenerative, and equitable agriculture—an unlikely alliance with historic potential for systemic change.

The goal: keep farms in business, incentivize resilient and regenerative agriculture, and begin healing political divides—starting with the principle that one more farm lost is one too many.
