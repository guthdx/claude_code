# Goals and Success Criteria

## Introduction

The A Better Way: Farm Safety Net Reform Initiative establishes clear, measurable goals and success criteria to guide the four-year project and evaluate its impact on preventing farm loss and reforming federal agricultural policy. These goals align with the initiative's dual approach of providing immediate crisis assistance through "No Farm Lost" while developing comprehensive policy solutions through "Rethinking the Safety Net." Success will be measured through both quantitative outcomes and qualitative changes in policy discourse and farmer resilience.

## Primary Goals

## Conclusion

These goals and success criteria provide a comprehensive framework for measuring the A Better Way initiative's impact on both immediate farmer needs and long-term policy reform. Success will ultimately be measured by the initiative's ability to prevent farm loss, reform inequitable safety net programs, and establish farmer ownership of land as a protected American value. The multi-year timeline allows for building momentum from crisis assistance toward systemic change while maintaining accountability through specific, measurable outcomes at each stage of the project.
