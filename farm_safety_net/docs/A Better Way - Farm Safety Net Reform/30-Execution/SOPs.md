# Standard Operating Procedures

## Introduction

This Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) document establishes the operational protocols for A Better Way: Farm Safety Net Reform Initiative, ensuring consistent implementation of both the "No Farm Lost" crisis assistance program and "Rethinking the Safety Net" policy development activities. These procedures guide daily operations, decision-making processes, and coordination between project components over the four-year initiative timeline from November 2025 through October 2029.

## Project Governance and Decision-Making

### Leadership Structure

The Project Director (Scott Marlow) maintains ultimate authority for project decisions, with Senior Advisors (Zachary Ducheneaux and Janie Hipp) providing strategic guidance on policy direction and implementation. Working group members serve in advisory capacity, contributing expertise through quarterly meetings and ongoing consultation.

### Decision Authority Matrix

- **Strategic Direction:** Project Director in consultation with Senior Advisors
- **Policy Development:** Working group consensus with Project Director approval
- **Crisis Response:** Project Director with immediate implementation authority
- **Communications:** Project Director with Senior Advisor review for sensitive materials
- **Partnership Agreements:** Project Director approval required for all formal partnerships

### Escalation Procedures

Issues requiring escalation follow this hierarchy:
1. Working group member concerns → Project Director
2. Policy disagreements → Senior Advisors consultation
3. Crisis situations → Immediate Project Director notification
4. External partnership conflicts → Senior Advisors and Project Director joint review
