# Project Brief

## Executive Summary

A Better Way: Farm Safety Net Reform Initiative is a four-year policy reform project addressing the most significant threat to farm viability since the 1980s farm crisis. Led by Scott Marlow of Long Rows Consulting, this initiative combines immediate crisis intervention through the "No Farm Lost" campaign with comprehensive policy development through "Rethinking the Safety Net." The project seeks to fundamentally restructure US farm safety net programs that currently favor large-scale industrial operations over family farms, accelerating farm consolidation and threatening the Jeffersonian ideal of farmer-owned land.

## Problem Statement

### Current Crisis Facing US Farmers

US commodity farmers face severe financial challenges from multiple converging factors: falling commodity prices, rising input costs, and ongoing trade disruptions. The current safety net programs systematically favor large-scale industrial farms over family-scale operations, accelerating farm loss and concentration of land ownership.

### Key Statistical Indicators

Data from the 2022 Census of Agriculture reveals the scope of the crisis:

- Cover crops utilized on less than 6% of US cropland despite decades of education and incentive programs
- Average farmer age increased from 57.5 to 58.1 years despite targeted beginning farmer programs
- $135 billion spent on ad hoc safety net programs over 8 years, yet 141,733 farms were lost between 2017-2022
- Disproportionate farm loss rates: Black farms lost at 8.1% rate, Native farms at 3.4%, White farms at 0.77%

### Systemic Policy Failures

The Market Facilitation Program (MFP) model implemented by the Trump administration exemplifies current safety net failures, providing the largest payments to the largest farms and accelerating consolidation rather than preventing farm loss. This approach threatens to transform American agriculture from farmer ownership to neo-feudalism, where farmland is increasingly owned by investment vehicles rather than farmers.

## Project Approach

### Two Integrated Initiatives

#### No Farm Lost Campaign

A communications campaign and resource hub providing immediate assistance to farmers in financial crisis:

- Emergency resources and guidance for farmers facing financial danger
- Farmer-to-farmer video testimonials and advice from crisis survivors
- Educational materials for organizations supporting farmers
- Public messaging emphasizing the importance of farmer ownership of land
- "Join Us" commitment campaign for public support of farmer ownership

#### Rethinking the Safety Net

A comprehensive policy development process creating a new safety net framework based on six core principles:

1. Equivalent benefits regardless of farm scale, crop type, or market participation
2. Recognition of multilevel resilience strategies that reduce operational risk
3. Support for agricultural diversification and decentralization
4. Encouragement of farmer innovation and entrepreneurship
5. Market concentration balance rather than amplification
6. Taxpayer cost limitation—true safety net function, not profit enhancement

## Implementation Strategy

### Three-Phase Communications Approach

**Phase 1: Foundation Building**
- Focus on farmer experience documentation and financial crisis awareness
- Build engagement infrastructure and communication channels
- Establish partnerships across traditional political and agricultural divides

**Phase 2: Analysis and Advocacy**
- Utilize farmer stories supported by comprehensive policy analysis
- Establish clear drivers and demonstrate need for systematic reform
- Build public understanding of safety net program failures

**Phase 3: Policy Release and Implementation**
- Release comprehensive policy reform recommendations
- Advocate for implementation through diverse stakeholder channels
- Support legislative and administrative reform initiatives

### Quarterly Working Group Process

The expert working group will convene quarterly to:

- Develop comprehensive policy evaluation criteria
- Test reform models through research and case study analysis
- Build strategic partnerships for policy implementation
- Create ongoing analysis framework for emerging agricultural policy issues

## Expected Outcomes

### Immediate Objectives

- Provide crisis intervention resources preventing immediate farm loss
- Document farmer experiences and safety net program failures
- Build coalition of stakeholders supporting comprehensive reform

### Long-term Goals

- Develop comprehensive vision for fundamental US farm policy restructuring
- Create specific legislative and administrative policy reform initiatives
- Establish ongoing agricultural policy analysis and advocacy capacity
- Prevent farm loss and transition to investment ownership of farmland
- Incentivize adoption of resilient and regenerative agricultural practices

## Strategic Rationale

### Moral and Strategic Imperative

Providing immediate crisis assistance serves both moral and strategic purposes. Farm financial crisis creates conditions for social extremism and community harm. Current safety net failures create an unprecedented opportunity to unite family-scale commodity producers with advocates for sustainable, regenerative, and equitable agriculture—forming an unlikely alliance with significant potential for systemic change.

### Political Opportunity

The convergence of farm financial crisis with growing awareness of agricultural consolidation creates unique conditions for bipartisan policy reform. The initiative's principle that "one more farm lost is one too many" transcends traditional political divisions and provides foundation for comprehensive safety net restructuring.

## Conclusion

A Better Way: Farm Safety Net Reform Initiative addresses both immediate crisis and long-term structural challenges facing American agriculture. Through integrated crisis intervention and policy development, the project aims to preserve farmer ownership of land, incentivize resilient agricultural practices, and begin healing political divides that have prevented meaningful agricultural policy reform. Success will require sustained commitment to both immediate farmer assistance and comprehensive policy restructuring over the four-year implementation period.
