# Glossary

## Introduction

This glossary provides definitions for key terms, concepts, and acronyms used throughout the A Better Way: Farm Safety Net Reform Initiative project documentation. These definitions are specific to the context of US agricultural policy, farm safety net programs, and the structural challenges facing American farmers.

## Agricultural Policy Terms

### Beginning Farmer Programs
Federal and state programs designed to support new farmers entering agriculture, typically targeting individuals who have been farming for less than 10 years. Despite these programs, the average farmer age continues to increase, indicating limited effectiveness in attracting new farmers.

### Commodity Farmers
Agricultural producers who grow crops that are traded as commodities, including corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, and other major field crops. These farmers are particularly vulnerable to price volatility and are the primary beneficiaries of federal safety net programs.

### Cover Crops
Crops planted primarily to benefit the soil and environment rather than for harvest, typically grown between main crop seasons. Despite decades of education and incentives, cover crops are used on less than 6% of US cropland according to the 2022 Census of Agriculture.

### Farm Concentration
The trend toward fewer, larger farming operations controlling increasing shares of agricultural production and land ownership. This process is accelerated by current safety net programs that provide larger payments to larger farms.

### Farm Loss
The permanent cessation of farming operations, often resulting in farmland being sold to non-farmers or consolidated into larger operations. Between 2017-2022, 141,733 farms were lost despite $135 billion spent on safety net programs.

### Market Facilitation Program (MFP)
A Trump administration program that provided direct payments to farmers affected by trade disputes. The MFP model exemplifies how current safety net structures favor large-scale operations, with the largest farms receiving the largest payments.

## Project-Specific Terms

### A Better Way
The overarching name for this four-year farm safety net reform initiative that combines immediate crisis assistance with long-term policy restructuring.

### No Farm Lost
The communications campaign and resource hub component of the initiative that provides immediate assistance to farmers in financial crisis, including farmer-to-farmer guidance, organizational resources, and public engagement campaigns.

### Rethinking the Safety Net
The policy development component that brings together experts to create a new safety net framework based on six core principles, including equivalent benefits regardless of scale and support for diversification.

### Six Principles
The foundational framework for safety net reform: (1) equivalent benefits regardless of scale, crop, or market; (2) recognize multilevel resilience strategies; (3) support diversification and decentralization; (4) encourage farmer innovation; (5) balance market concentration; (6) limit taxpayer cost.

## Policy and Program Acronyms

### FSA
Farm Service Agency - The USDA agency responsible for implementing most federal farm safety net programs, including commodity price support programs, conservation programs, and disaster assistance.

### MFP
Market Facilitation Program - The trade-war related payment program that demonstrated how current safety net structures accelerate farm consolidation.

### SDFR
Sustainable Development and Food Research - Referenced in connection with policy analyst Conisha Hackett Brumfield's affiliation with the SDFR Policy Center at Alcorn State.

### USDA
United States Department of Agriculture - The federal department responsible for developing and executing federal policy on farming, forestry, food, and related issues.

## Structural and Social Terms

### Family-Scale Operations
Farms that are operated by families rather than corporations or investment entities, typically smaller in scale than industrial operations but representing the traditional model of American agriculture.

### Jeffersonian Ideal
The philosophical concept that widespread farmer ownership of land is fundamental to American democracy and social stability, named after Thomas Jefferson's vision of an agrarian republic.

### Neo-Feudalism
The emerging pattern where farmland is increasingly owned by investment vehicles rather than the farmers who work it, creating a landlord-tenant relationship reminiscent of feudal systems.

### Multilevel Resilience Strategies
Approaches that build farm resilience at multiple scales - individual farm, community, and regional levels - through diversification, soil health, and other risk-reduction practices.

## Financial and Economic Terms

### Ad Hoc Safety Net Programs
Emergency assistance programs created in response to specific crises rather than as part of permanent policy structure. $135 billion was spent on such programs over eight years with limited effectiveness in preventing farm loss.

### Input Costs
The expenses farmers incur for seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, fuel, and other materials needed for production. Rising input costs combined with falling commodity prices create the financial pressure driving the current farm crisis.

### Price Volatility
The tendency for commodity prices to fluctuate significantly, creating uncertainty for farmers in planning and budgeting. Current safety net programs inadequately address this fundamental challenge.

## Geographic and Demographic Terms

### Black Farms
Farms owned and operated by Black farmers, which experienced an 8.1% loss rate between 2017-2022, significantly higher than the overall farm loss rate and indicating systemic inequities in current programs.

### Native Farms
Farms owned and operated by Native American farmers, which experienced a 3.4% loss rate between 2017-2022, also above the rate for White-owned farms.

### Rural Viability
The economic and social sustainability of rural communities, which is directly connected to the health of local farming operations and threatened by ongoing farm consolidation.

## Implementation Terms

### Strategic Partnerships
Collaborative relationships with diverse organizations needed to implement policy reforms, ranging from farm organizations to policy research institutions to advocacy groups.

### Three-Phase Communications Strategy
The project's planned approach: Phase 1 focuses on farmer experience and infrastructure building; Phase 2 uses farmer stories with policy analysis; Phase 3 releases and advocates for specific policy reforms.

### Working Group
The quarterly-meeting body of policy experts responsible for developing policy criteria, testing models, and building implementation partnerships for the Rethinking the Safety Net initiative.
