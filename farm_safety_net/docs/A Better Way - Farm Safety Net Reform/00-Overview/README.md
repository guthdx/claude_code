# Project Overview

## Introduction

A Better Way: Farm Safety Net Reform Initiative represents a critical four-year effort to address the most significant threat to farm viability since the 1980s farm crisis. This comprehensive initiative combines immediate crisis intervention with long-term systemic policy reform to fundamentally restructure US farm safety net programs. The project addresses the urgent financial challenges facing commodity farmers while tackling the underlying structural issues that systematically favor large-scale industrial operations over family-scale farms.

## Project Background and Problem Statement

### Current Crisis Context

US commodity farmers are experiencing severe financial distress due to multiple converging factors including falling commodity prices, rising input costs, and ongoing trade disruptions. The 2022 Census of Agriculture reveals alarming trends that demonstrate the failure of current safety net programs to protect farm viability and prevent consolidation.

### Key Indicators of System Failure

The data from the 2022 Census of Agriculture illustrates the scope of the crisis:

- Cover crops implemented on less than 6% of US cropland despite decades of education and incentive programs
- Average farmer age increased from 57.5 to 58.1 years, indicating failure of beginning farmer programs
- $135 billion spent on ad hoc safety net programs over eight years, yet 141,733 farms were lost between 2017-2022
- Disproportionate farm loss rates: Black farms at 8.1%, Native farms at 3.4%, White farms at 0.77%

### Structural Problems with Current Safety Net

The existing safety net framework, exemplified by the Market Facilitation Program (MFP) model, systematically provides the largest payments to the largest farms. This approach accelerates farm consolidation rather than preventing farm loss, contributing to a shift from farmer-owned land to investment vehicle ownership—a transition from the Jeffersonian ideal to what the project characterizes as agricultural neo-feudalism.

## Project Components and Strategic Approach

### Dual Initiative Framework

The project operates through two integrated initiatives that address both immediate crisis response and long-term structural reform:

#### No Farm Lost Initiative

This communications campaign and resource hub provides immediate support through:

- **Crisis Resources**: Direct assistance and guidance for farmers facing financial danger
- **Peer Support Network**: Farmer-to-farmer videos and guidance from those who successfully navigated previous crises
- **Organizational Support**: Materials and resources for organizations working directly with farmers
- **Public Engagement**: Clear messaging about the importance of farmer ownership of land
- **Community Mobilization**: "Join Us" campaign for public commitment to supporting farmer ownership

#### Rethinking the Safety Net Initiative

This policy development process creates a new safety net framework based on six core principles:

1. **Scale Equity**: Equivalent benefits regardless of farm scale, crop type, or market participation
2. **Resilience Recognition**: Acknowledgment of multilevel resilience strategies that reduce operational risk
3. **Diversification Support**: Active encouragement of diversification and decentralization
4. **Innovation Incentives**: Support for farmer innovation and entrepreneurship
5. **Market Balance**: Policies that balance rather than amplify market concentration
6. **Fiscal Responsibility**: Limited taxpayer cost through true safety net function rather than profit center approach

### Policy Development Process

The policy development component utilizes a working group of recognized experts meeting quarterly to:

- Develop comprehensive policy criteria and evaluation frameworks
- Test policy models through research and practical casework
- Build strategic partnerships necessary for effective implementation
- Create specific legislative and administrative policy recommendations

## Project Leadership and Governance

### Project Direction

**Scott Marlow** serves as Project Director, bringing extensive experience as former Deputy Administrator for Farm Programs and Senior Advisor to Administrator at USDA Farm Service Agency. His 25+ years of experience in farm and rural viability includes oversight of more than $20 billion in farmer assistance programs.

### Senior Advisory Team

**Zachary Ducheneaux** (Fifth C) provides senior advisory support as former Administrator of USDA FSA and former Executive Director of the Intertribal Agriculture Council.

**Janie Hipp** (CEO/President, Native Agriculture Finance Services) contributes expertise as former USDA General Counsel.

### Expert Working Group

The project has invited participation from leading policy experts and researchers including:

- Jonathan Coppess (University of Illinois), former FSA Administrator
- Andrew Green, former Senior Advisor for Fair and Competitive Markets, USDA
- Conisha Hackett Brumfield, Policy Analyst SDFR Policy Center, Alcorn State
- Eric Deeble, former USDA Deputy Undersecretary
- Mary Hendrickson (University of Missouri), Director Interdisciplinary Center for Food Security
- Julie Dawson, University of Wisconsin-Madison
- Norbert Wilson (Duke University), Director World Food Policy Center

## Implementation Strategy

### Three-Phase Communications Approach

**Phase 1: Foundation Building**
- Focus on documenting and sharing farmer experiences with financial crisis
- Build engagement infrastructure and communication channels
- Establish partnerships across traditional political and agricultural divides

**Phase 2: Analysis and Advocacy**
- Utilize farmer stories supported by rigorous policy analysis
- Establish clear connections between individual experiences and systemic drivers
- Build case for comprehensive reform through diverse stakeholder engagement

**Phase 3: Policy Release and Implementation**
- Release comprehensive policy reform recommendations
- Advocate for adoption through multiple channels and partnerships
- Support implementation through ongoing technical assistance and monitoring

## Expected Outcomes and Impact

### Primary Deliverables

- Comprehensive vision for fundamental change to US farm policy structure
- Specific legislative and administrative policy initiatives ready for implementation
- Ongoing analytical capacity for emerging agricultural policy issues
- Strategic organizing and advocacy framework for policy implementation
- Measurable prevention of farm loss and transition to investment ownership

### Strategic Impact

The project aims to create lasting change by:

- Keeping existing farms in operation through improved crisis response
- Incentivizing adoption of resilient and regenerative agricultural practices
- Beginning to heal political divides through shared commitment to farm viability
- Establishing the principle that "one more farm lost is one too many"

## Project Rationale and Broader Significance

### Moral and Strategic Imperative

Providing crisis assistance serves both moral and strategic purposes. Farm financial crisis has become a recruiting ground for political extremism and a source of broader social harm. The project recognizes that addressing farm viability is essential for community stability and democratic resilience.

### Coalition Building Opportunity

Current safety net failures create an unprecedented opportunity to unite family-scale commodity producers with advocates for sustainable, regenerative, and equitable agriculture. This unlikely alliance has historic potential for achieving systemic change that has been impossible through traditional advocacy approaches.

### Long-term Vision

The ultimate goal extends beyond policy reform to fundamental transformation of the relationship between farmers, land ownership, and agricultural production. By maintaining farmer ownership of land and supporting resilient agricultural practices, the project works toward healing both agricultural and political divides while ensuring the viability of American agriculture for future generations.
