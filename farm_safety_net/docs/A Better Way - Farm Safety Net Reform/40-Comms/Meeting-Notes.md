## Meeting Objectives

1. Formally launch the Working Group for "Rethinking the Safety Net" initiative
2. Review project framework and six guiding principles
3. Establish working group protocols and meeting cadence
4. Discuss initial policy research priorities
5. Coordinate with "No Farm Lost" crisis assistance activities

## Key Discussion Points

### Project Framework Review

Scott Marlow opened the meeting by reviewing the initiative's dual approach: immediate crisis assistance through "No Farm Lost" and systemic policy reform through "Rethinking the Safety Net." The group discussed how the 2022 Census of Agriculture data reinforces the urgency of the work, particularly the continued farm loss rates and the concerning disparities in loss rates by race.

Zachary Ducheneaux emphasized the particular impact on Native farms, noting that the 3.4% loss rate represents not just economic hardship but cultural and sovereignty concerns for tribal communities.

### Six Principles Discussion

The working group spent significant time examining each of the six principles for safety net reform:

**Principle 1 - Equivalent Benefits:** Jonathan Coppess raised questions about implementation challenges, particularly around crop insurance structures that inherently favor certain commodities and regions.

**Principle 2 - Multilevel Resilience:** Julie Dawson highlighted opportunities to connect this principle with existing research on farm diversification and agroecological practices.

**Principle 3 - Diversification Support:** Mary Hendrickson noted the tension between current program structures that reward specialization and the goal of supporting diversification.

**Principle 4 - Innovation Support:** Andrew Green discussed how current programs can inadvertently discourage innovation through rigid compliance requirements.

**Principle 5 - Market Balance:** Conisha Hackett Brumfield emphasized the importance of this principle for addressing historical inequities in program access and benefits.

**Principle 6 - Cost Limitation:** Eric Deeble provided context on budget realities and the need for politically viable cost structures.

### Research Priorities Identification

The group identified three priority areas for initial policy research:

1. **Payment Structure Analysis:** Comparative analysis of current programs (crop insurance, ARC, PLC, conservation programs) to identify how benefits flow by farm size, crop type, and geographic region.

2. **Alternative Models Research:** Review of safety net approaches in other countries and sectors that could inform US farm policy reform.

3. **Implementation Pathways:** Assessment of administrative and legislative pathways for implementing principle-based reforms.

### Crisis Response Coordination

Janie Hipp provided an update on "No Farm Lost" activities, noting that the resource hub development is progressing and initial farmer-to-farmer video content is being collected. The group discussed how crisis assistance cases could inform policy development by identifying specific program failures and gaps.

## Action Items

### For Project Leadership:
- **Scott Marlow:** Develop research framework document outlining methodology for payment structure analysis (Due: December 1, 2025)
- **Zachary Ducheneaux:** Coordinate with tribal agricultural organizations to gather input on safety net reform priorities (Due: December 15, 2025)
- **Janie Hipp:** Share monthly "No Farm Lost" activity reports with working group to inform policy discussions (Ongoing)

### For Working Group Members:
- **Jonathan Coppess & Eric Deeble:** Lead payment structure analysis research, focusing on ARC/PLC programs (Due: January 15, 2026)
- **Andrew Green & Mary Hendrickson:** Research international and alternative safety net models (Due: January 15, 2026)
- **Julie Dawson & Conisha Hackett Brumfield:** Develop framework for assessing resilience and equity impacts of proposed reforms (Due: January 30, 2026)

### For All Members:
- Review and provide feedback on research framework document once distributed
- Identify potential strategic partners within their networks for future engagement
- Collect examples of current safety net program failures that illustrate need for reform

## Next Meeting

**Date:** February 20, 2026  
**Format:** Virtual, 2 hours  
**Primary Agenda:** Review initial research findings and begin developing policy criteria framework

## Key Decisions Made

1. Working group will meet quarterly as planned, with additional subgroup meetings as needed for research activities
2. Research will be conducted collaboratively with pairs of members leading each priority area
3. Policy development will be informed by both quantitative analysis and case studies from crisis assistance work
4. Strategic partnership identification will be ongoing priority for all members

## Meeting Evaluation

The inaugural working group meeting successfully established the collaborative framework needed for policy development work. Strong engagement from all attendees and clear alignment on project principles provides solid foundation for moving forward. The integration between crisis assistance and policy research was well-received and will strengthen both initiatives.

The expertise and experience represented in the working group positions the project well to develop credible, implementable policy alternatives that address the fundamental challenges facing US farm safety net programs.
