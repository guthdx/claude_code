## Next Steps

The initiative continues building toward Phase 2 implementation while maintaining focus on immediate crisis assistance for farmers. Upcoming priorities include expanding resource availability, deepening policy analysis, and strengthening the coalition of unlikely allies committed to preventing farm loss and reforming safety net programs to support farmer ownership of land.
