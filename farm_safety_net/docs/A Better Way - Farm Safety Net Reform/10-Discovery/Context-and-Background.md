# Context and Background

## Introduction

A Better Way: Farm Safety Net Reform Initiative emerges from a critical convergence of agricultural, economic, and social challenges that threaten the foundation of American farming. This four-year initiative addresses what experts identify as the most significant threat to farm viability since the 1980s farm crisis, when thousands of family farms were lost to bankruptcy and foreclosure. The project recognizes that current farm safety net programs, rather than protecting vulnerable farmers, systematically accelerate farm consolidation and the transition from farmer-owned land to investment-owned agricultural assets.

## Historical Context of Farm Safety Net Programs

### Evolution of Federal Farm Policy

US farm safety net programs have evolved significantly since the New Deal era, when they were first established to address agricultural market volatility and rural economic stability. Originally designed to support family-scale farming operations, these programs have undergone multiple iterations through successive Farm Bills, with each revision reflecting changing political priorities and economic conditions.

The fundamental structure of current safety net programs was established through decades of legislative compromises that increasingly favored production-based payments and market-oriented approaches. This evolution has created a system where the largest farms receive the largest benefits, directly contradicting the original intent of supporting vulnerable agricultural producers.

### The 1980s Farm Crisis as Precedent

The 1980s farm crisis provides critical context for understanding the current situation facing American farmers. During that period, falling commodity prices, high interest rates, and excessive debt loads led to widespread farm failures, rural bank closures, and significant social disruption in agricultural communities. The crisis demonstrated the interconnected nature of farm financial health, rural community stability, and broader economic security.

Key parallels between the 1980s crisis and current conditions include commodity price volatility, rising input costs, and inadequate safety net responses that failed to prevent farm loss. However, the current crisis occurs within a fundamentally different agricultural landscape, characterized by greater consolidation, more complex global supply chains, and the emergence of non-farmer investment in farmland.

## Current Agricultural Landscape

### Farm Financial Stress Indicators

Contemporary US agriculture faces multiple converging pressures that create unprecedented financial stress for commodity producers. Falling commodity prices, driven by global market dynamics and trade disruptions, have reduced gross farm income while production costs continue rising. Input costs for fertilizer, fuel, and equipment have increased substantially, creating a cost-price squeeze that particularly impacts medium-scale operations.

Trade wars and international market disruptions have further complicated farmer financial planning, creating uncertainty that makes long-term investment decisions increasingly difficult. The resulting financial stress manifests in increased debt-to-asset ratios, declining farm equity, and growing numbers of farms operating at or near break-even levels.

### Demographic and Structural Changes

The 2022 Census of Agriculture reveals concerning trends in farm demographics and structure that provide essential context for safety net reform. The average farmer age increased from 57.5 to 58.1 years despite decades of beginning farmer programs, indicating that efforts to attract new farmers have been insufficient to offset retirements and farm exits.

Farm loss patterns show significant disparities across racial and ethnic lines, with Black farms lost at an 8.1% rate and Native farms at a 3.4% rate, compared to 0.77% for White farms. These disparities reflect historical inequities in access to credit, technical assistance, and safety net programs that the current initiative must address.

### Land Ownership Transformation

A fundamental shift in agricultural land ownership patterns provides critical context for understanding the urgency of safety net reform. The traditional model of farmer-owned land is increasingly giving way to investment ownership, where farmland becomes a financial asset held by non-farming entities. This transition represents what project leadership characterizes as a move from the Jeffersonian ideal of farmer-owned land toward agricultural neo-feudalism.

Investment ownership of farmland creates multiple challenges for working farmers, including reduced access to land for purchase, increased rental costs, and pressure for short-term production decisions that may conflict with long-term soil health and sustainability goals. The trend accelerates when farmers in financial distress are forced to sell land to investment buyers rather than to other farmers.

## Safety Net Program Failures

### Scale-Based Inequities

Current safety net programs systematically favor large-scale operations through payment structures that provide larger absolute benefits to farms with higher production volumes. This approach contradicts the safety net principle of providing proportional protection based on need rather than scale. The Market Facilitation Program (MFP) implemented during the Trump administration exemplifies this problem, with the largest farms receiving the largest payments despite having greater financial resources to weather market disruptions.

Payment caps and means testing provisions in existing programs have proven inadequate to address scale-based inequities. These provisions often contain exceptions and loopholes that allow large operations to maintain access to substantial program benefits while smaller farms face proportionally higher administrative burdens and more restrictive eligibility requirements.

### Limited Conservation Adoption

Despite decades of education, technical assistance, and financial incentives, conservation practice adoption remains limited across US agriculture. Cover crops, widely recognized as a fundamental soil health practice, are used on less than 6% of US cropland according to the 2022 Census of Agriculture. This low adoption rate indicates that current program structures fail to adequately incentivize practices that build farm resilience and reduce production risk.

The disconnect between conservation program goals and farmer adoption patterns suggests that safety net programs have not effectively integrated risk reduction benefits of conservation practices into their payment and eligibility structures. Farmers continue to view conservation as an additional cost rather than a risk management strategy, indicating fundamental flaws in program design and implementation.

### Inadequate Crisis Response

The expenditure of $135 billion on ad hoc safety net programs over eight years, combined with the loss of 141,733 farms between 2017-2022, demonstrates the fundamental inadequacy of current crisis response mechanisms. These programs have failed to achieve their primary objective of preventing farm loss while consuming substantial public resources.

Ad hoc program responses typically occur after farmers are already in severe financial distress, limiting their effectiveness as prevention tools. The reactive rather than proactive nature of current safety net programs means that intervention often comes too late to prevent farm failure and forced land sales to non-farming investors.

## Political and Social Context

### Rural Political Dynamics

Farm financial stress has created political vulnerabilities that extend beyond agricultural policy into broader social and political stability concerns. Financial crisis among farmers has historically served as a recruiting ground for political extremism and has contributed to social tensions in rural communities. The current farm financial situation occurs within a highly polarized political environment that complicates policy responses.

The project recognizes that effective safety net reform must address both the immediate financial needs of farmers and the broader political dynamics that farm financial stress creates. Crisis assistance serves both moral and strategic purposes by addressing human suffering while reducing social instability and political radicalization.

### Unlikely Alliance Potential

Current safety net failures have created an unusual opportunity for coalition building across traditional political and ideological divides. Family-scale commodity producers, who have historically aligned with conventional agricultural interests, increasingly share common ground with advocates for sustainable, regenerative, and equitable agriculture in recognizing the need for fundamental system reform.

This convergence of interests creates potential for what project leadership identifies as an "unlikely alliance with historic potential for systemic change." The shared experience of inadequate safety net protection provides a foundation for collaboration between groups that have previously worked in opposition on agricultural policy issues.

## Urgency and Timing

### Critical Juncture

The current moment represents a critical juncture in American agricultural history, where policy decisions made in the next several years will determine whether the trend toward investment ownership of farmland becomes irreversible. Each farm lost to financial distress represents not only individual tragedy but also permanent reduction in the number of farmer-owned operations.

The four-year timeline for the initiative reflects recognition that comprehensive safety net reform requires sustained effort across multiple policy cycles. However, the immediate crisis facing farmers demands parallel action to prevent farm loss during the period required for systemic reform implementation.

### Window for Reform

Political and economic conditions have created a window of opportunity for fundamental safety net reform that may not remain open indefinitely. Growing awareness of agricultural consolidation risks, combined with farmer financial stress across diverse production systems, has created broader public and political support for reform than has existed in previous decades.

The initiative's timing recognizes that effective reform requires building public understanding and political support before proposing specific policy changes. The three-phase communications strategy reflects this understanding by beginning with farmer experience and crisis response before advancing to policy analysis and reform advocacy.
