# Stakeholder Notes

## Project Overview

The A Better Way: Farm Safety Net Reform Initiative represents a critical four-year effort to address the most severe agricultural crisis since the 1980s. This initiative combines immediate crisis intervention with comprehensive policy reform to prevent farm loss and restructure safety net programs that currently favor large-scale operations over family farms. The project's dual approach—"No Farm Lost" and "Rethinking the Safety Net"—addresses both urgent farmer needs and systemic policy failures.

## Key Stakeholder Categories

- **Diversified and sustainable agriculture practitioners** seeking policy support for resilient farming practices

#### Policy and Government Stakeholders
- **USDA Farm Service Agency** and related program administrators
- **Congressional agriculture committees** responsible for farm bill legislation
- **State agriculture departments** implementing federal programs
- **Tribal agriculture councils** representing Native farming interests

#### Academic and Research Community

## Stakeholder Interests and Concerns

### Immediate Crisis Response
Farmers in financial distress require immediate access to resources, guidance, and crisis intervention. Agricultural lenders and rural communities share concerns about farm bankruptcy rates and their cascading economic effects. Mental health and social service providers recognize the urgent need for farmer support systems during financial crisis.

### Policy Reform Priorities
Family-scale producers seek safety net programs that provide equivalent benefits regardless of operation size, while large-scale operations may resist changes that reduce their current advantages. Agricultural economists and policy researchers support evidence-based reforms that address market concentration and promote farm resilience.

### Land Ownership and Access
Beginning farmers and minority producers face significant barriers to land access, while investment entities increasingly view farmland as a financial asset. Rural communities and agricultural organizations share concerns about the transition from farmer-owned to investor-owned land and its implications for rural economies.

### Market and Economic Considerations
Agricultural service providers and rural businesses depend on farm viability for their own sustainability. Commodity organizations balance diverse member interests across different operation scales. Financial institutions require stable agricultural policies that support long-term farm viability and loan performance.

## Stakeholder Engagement Strategy

### Communication Approaches
The project's three-phase communication strategy addresses different stakeholder needs and timelines. Phase 1 focuses on farmer experience and crisis response, engaging agricultural organizations and support networks. Phase 2 develops policy analysis backed by farmer stories, targeting academic and policy stakeholders. Phase 3 advocates for specific reforms through diverse channels reaching all stakeholder categories.

### Partnership Development
The initiative builds "unlikely partnerships" between family-scale commodity producers and advocates for sustainable agriculture, creating broader coalition potential. Academic partnerships through the working group provide research credibility and policy expertise. Government partnerships leverage existing relationships and administrative experience of project leadership.

### Addressing Stakeholder Conflicts
Large-scale agricultural operations may resist reforms that reduce their safety net advantages, requiring careful messaging about overall program effectiveness and taxpayer value. Investment entities acquiring farmland may oppose policies promoting farmer ownership, necessitating focus on rural economic stability and community benefits.

## Expected Stakeholder Impacts

### Positive Outcomes
Family-scale farmers gain access to crisis resources and more equitable safety net programs. Rural communities benefit from reduced farm loss and maintained farmer land ownership. Agricultural researchers and policy experts contribute to evidence-based reform development. Beginning and minority farmers receive improved access to programs and land ownership opportunities.

### Potential Challenges
Large-scale operations may experience reduced safety net benefits under reformed programs. Investment entities may face policy barriers to farmland acquisition. Some agricultural organizations may need to balance competing member interests across different operation scales. Policy stakeholders must navigate complex political dynamics around agricultural program reform.

## Stakeholder Success Metrics

Ongoing stakeholder feedback will inform both crisis response resources and policy reform development, ensuring the initiative addresses real farmer needs while building support for systemic change.
